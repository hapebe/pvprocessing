# Exploring Fast-API

I follow i.a. https://hellocoding.de/blog/coding-language/python/fastapi .

## Installation

I decided not to worry about virtualenv etc.; and neither did I use sudo to do the following:

```
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

At that point I already learned about ASGI (https://asgi.readthedocs.io/) servers in the Python universe.
